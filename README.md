The slender leaves of a specimen of *Dioscorea villosa* are pressed, preserved, labeled, and stored in the [Harvard University Herbaria](https://data.huh.harvard.edu/databases/specimen_search.php?mode=details&id=757842), collected in Massachusetts in 1903.[^ref1] The winged seedpods are flattened between the leaves, and the vine dried, turning from a bright, light green to faded brown. Though the herbaceous plant, informally known as wild yam, can grow up to 30 feet, the sample is much shorter, coiled onto itself to fit onto the standardized paper for botanists and other researchers to study.  This specimen exemplifies the limitation of the standard botanical herbarium sheet: the plant is desiccated, the stem is trimmed, and the roots and rhizomes, which are vital to the story of wild yam, are torn off.

Rhizomes are often confused with roots. They are found underground, but they are stems. The rhizome grows underground horizontally, and sends out roots and shoots from nodes. Rhizomes allow plants to reproduce asexually from pieces of the rhizone containing a node. Many familiar plants, including bamboo, ginger, hops, and wild yams include a subterranean rhizome.[^ref2]

While *Dioscorea villosa* is native and widespread across the eastern United States, the rhizomes , which are omitted from the sample, have been used in indigenous and modern medicine for hundreds of years. In the twentieth century, colonial bioprospectors harvested *Dioscorea villosa*’s rhizomes to mass produce the birth control pill. Since the 1960s, the rhizomes have reshaped lives, landscapes and water bodies across the globe.[^ref3] This story is lost in the faded tangle of stems presented on contemporary herbarium sheets. To untangle this complex narrative, we require new forms of representation that expand on the plant’s subterranean rhizomes.

### Representing the Roots
Long before  the herbaria sample was flattened, dried, and adhered to a paper sheet in 1903, a watercolor-painting of *Dioscorea villosa* with its associated name in Nahuatl, *macayelli*, was immortalized in a Mexica herbal, known as the Badianus manuscript, in the 1550s.[^ref4] In it, an indigenous artist portrays wild yam by showing the whole plant, from its three-tuber underground root system to its above-ground complex of vines laden with flowers and winged seed pods.[^ref5] In addition to containing such images and Nahuatl names for plants, the herbal documents the medicinal properties of plants used by indigenous populations of the Americas.  Indeed, its text describes *Dioscorea villosa* or *macayelli* as an analgesic, or pain reliever.

The indigenous artist painted the rhizomes, roots and leaves with an equal emphasis . While representing whole plants with roots had become a somewhat standard practice in European illustrations of plants, the painting nonetheless helps the reader understand that its medicinal qualities derive from the whole plant, not only what’s visible above ground.

### What's in a Family Name? 
*Dioscorea villosa* was used by indigenous peoples in North and Central America for centuries before it was encountered, described, and visually represented by colonial botanists. The genus Dioscorea was named by Charles Plumier, a French colonial botanist, who encountered the plant during his journeys to the western Caribbean in 1689, 1693, and 1695. Plumier published a description and illustration of *Dioscorea* along with many other findings from his three botanical expeditions in *Nova Plantarum Americanarum Genera*, in 1703.[^ref6] Like other European botanists of his day, Plumier was sent to the Americas to selectively explore and investigate species for the purpose of finding commercially valuable botanical resources, a practice now known as bioprospecting. As Gian Carlo Delgado writes, bioprospecting, “relies on the knowledge of rural and indigenous communities that have established an intimate relationship with nature since precapitalist times.”[^ref7] Botany became another tool of colonial expansion in the 18th century that continues to extract indigenous knowledge to this day.[^ref8]

Botanists like Plumier relied on local knowledge to collect samples and knowledge of plant species to catalog. Plumier named the genus *Dioscorea* after the Greek physician and botanist *Dioscorides*, who published his work on medicinal plants in *De materia media*, an herbal encyclopedia that was used in European medicine from its creation around 50 CE. [^ref9]

American botanists continued to extract information from indigenous groups  and publish about the medicinal uses of the species. In an 1887 volume of *American medicinal plants: an illustrated and descriptive guide to the American plants used as homeopathic remedies: their history, preparation, chemistry and physical effects*, Charles Frederick Milspaugh identifies additional uses of the plant including treating bilious colic, which we know as gallstones, as a way to induce sweating, cause vomiting and treat coughs. The plant is also noted to treat ‘dysmennorhea’ and kindred afflictions, which we know as menstrual cramps.[^ref10] Milspaugh offers a method to extract a tonic from the roots, which are abundant and easy to collect.[^ref11]

While botanists had written extensively about the medicinal uses of *Dioscorea villosa* throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the exploitation of *Dioscorea*, and other species in the genus, accelerated during the twentieth century, as western nations raced to develop sex hormones. *Dioscorea villosa*, native to the eastern United States, would become a central figure in the global development of the birth control pill. This development relied on massive biopiracy operations in Mexico, where the plant’s medicinal uses were first recorded in Early Modern period documents. 


### Modern Chemistry: Inventing the Marker Degradation

In 1938, Russell E. Marker, a chemist working at Pennsylvania State University, successfully synthesized progesterone, a sex hormone, from sapogenin, a naturally occurring compound in sarsaparilla, an herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States where Marker was working. Progesterone had been discovered by doctors earlier in the 1930s, who used the sex hormone to treat menstrual disorders and pregnancies. The process to synthesize progesterone, the Marker degradation, was named for him.[^ref13] But synthesizing progesterone from sarsaparilla was prohibitively expensive, and Marker knew he needed a different source to make progesterone more affordable. The answer came to him from Japanese colleagues, who discovered a compound called diosgenin, which they extracted from the roots of *Dioscorea tokoro*, a wild yam species abundant in eastern Asia.[^ref14] Their paper sent Marker to the Penn State library to study botany in search of a widely distributed source of diosgenin. Marker found his answer outside his laboratory in the roots of *Dioscorea villosa*.

Marker was not a botanist, nor was he particularly interested in plants. Yet, in 1940, he published that he had successfully extracted “the powdered rhizomes of *Dioscorea villosa* with a procedure similar to that used in the isolation of sarsapogenin.”[^ref15] He compared a sample of diosgenin that his Japanese colleagues sent, produced from Dioscorea tokoro, to confirm his results from *Dioscorea villosa*. He successfully produced progesterone from diosgenin that same year. Marker’s experiments confirmed that the genus *Dioscorea* was a readily available source of diosgenin, which could revolutionize the expensive production of progesterone.

### Striking Out: Marker in the Mexican Landscape

However, the yield of diosgenin from *Dioscorea villosa* was low, and therefore not economically feasible, so Marker tried producing the compound from other plants, including Beth root, or *Trillium erectum* that he gathered on an expedition to North Carolina. On the trip, he noted “the roots are only about the size of your thumb. Collection of one hundred pounds a year would be about the limit.”[^ref16] In 1942, he updated his findings, writing “the easy conversion of diosgenin to progesterone made necessary the investigation of additional plant sources.” He lists eight additional species, all sampled in the eastern United States.[^ref17]

Marker ultimately decided that “no plant in northern North American contained sufficient material to be an inexhaustible source of steroids for medicinal purposes,” and set out beyond the eastern United States in search of an economically feasible source of diosgenin, focusing on the genus *Dioscorea*.[^ref18] Botanists from Penn State connected him to their networks, and, while spending time with a botanist in Texas, he flipped to a random book by his bedside, where he saw a large, tuberous root. The caption read, “This specimen was collected just where the highway from Mexico to Veracruz, between Orizaba and Cordoba, crosses over the Barranca [gorge] de Metlac.” He left the United States for Mexico in 1941, searching for a species he knew in his extremely limited Spanish as “cabeza de negro.”[^ref19]

       region="-306,-942,7515,6346">

World War II shortened Marker’s first collecting trip, and he returned in 1942, travelling with a Mexican botanist who confirmed the “cabeza de negro” species as a relative of Dioscorea villosa, called *Dioscorea macrostachya*, now called *Dioscorea mexicana*, found in Veracruz in central Mexico.[^ref20] After a falling out with the Mexican botanist, Marker, with his limited Spanish, boarded a bus himself for Orizaba, Veracruz. He got off the bus and asked a local shop owner, Alberto Moreno, for a specimen. Moreno helped him load two large tubers of “cabeza de negro” onto the bus. His tubers were confiscated on his return trip, and he was only able to bribe a local policeman enough to return one tuber, which he smuggled out of the country, back to his lab at Pennsylvania State University.[^ref21]

       region="1171,114,3341,2774">

Marker had committed an act of biopiracy in bringing the plant back to the United States. He entered the sovereign state of Mexico with an introductory letter expressing his interest in “working on some hormone projects intimately related to the National Defense [of the United States].”[^ref22] He viewed the plant as a natural resource for drug development, without consideration of the deep-rooted history or indigenous traditions associated with the plant.[^ref23] The species were interchangeable, except for the amount of diosgenin in their roots.[^ref24]

In the following decades, the Mexican steroid industry reshaped the Mexican landscape. Over the years, Marker collected twenty forms of Dioscorea throughout Mexico. He readily abandoned *Dioscorea mexicana* for *Dioscorea composita*, known locally as *barbasco*, for its higher diosgenin content.[^ref25] Marker created a set of operations to cultivate and collect wild yams, test the rhizome and produce diosgenin.[^ref26] At its height, Syntex employed 25,000 *campesinos*, Mexican farmers, to cultivate and harvest wild yam and 3,000 people to produce diosgenin.  An infrastructure of roads and distribution facilities were established across Veracruz to facilitate the exploitation of barbasco for the pharmaceutical trade.[^ref27] The farmers collected 75,000 tons of roots per year to use in the production of the birth control pill, which was developed over two decades after Marker originally discovered *Dioscorea* as an economic source of diosgenin to produce progesterone.[^ref28]

### From Plant to Pill 

In 1951, Carl Djerassi, working at Syntex, developed a synthetic form of progesterone, called progestrin, from barbasco rhizomes, but did not develop it into a contraceptive.[^ref29] The next year, Gregory Pincus, funded by Katherine McCormick and Margaret Sanger of Planned Parenthood and working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), successfully synthesized a two-ingredient estrogen-progesterone pill. The invention had revolutionary implications for women around the globe.[^ref30]

       author="Marions Trikosko, 1968. Library of Congress."
       region="22,-54,941,797">
       
The clinical trials for the pill could not be conducted at MIT in Massachusetts, where birth control studies were banned, without incurring a $1000 fine per trial . Instead, the team began medical trials of the pill in Puerto Rico, which have since been condemned for their lack of informed consent by today’s standards.[^ref31] 

Plants in the *Dioscorea* genus were planted around the world for economic gain as lab tests began through the late 1950s, with scientists breeding tubers with higher diosgenin concentrations to use to manufacture the pill. Clinical studies in Sri Lanka, the United States, Haiti, Hong Kong, Japan and Mexico began in 1960, and by 1961 half a million women were using the pill to regulate menstruation and pregnancy.[^ref32] Today, the pill is available across the globe, and is one of the most popular forms of contraceptive, despite ongoing attempts to regulate its usage.[^ref33]  

### Re-Rooting *Dioscorea villosa*

*Dioscorea villosa*, and the industry that emerged from Marker’s first proof that progesterone could be synthesized from the genus, has reshaped human life on Earth. Situating  the plant in this entanglement of reproductive hormones, policy and moving into the present, the story of *Dioscorea villosa* and its role in the development of the birth control pill becomes more complex. Global use of the pill has come with side effects, including an influx of progesterone and estrogen, another sex hormone used in many birth control pills, into municipal water systems, which are discharged in the absence of reverse osmosis systems. The estrogen flows through sewers into water bodies across the globe, finally flowing into the ocean and remaking the chemistry of our largest commons at a planetary scale, where increasing synthetic hormone levels impact the fertility of humans as well as marine and terrestrial animals alike.[^ref34][^ref35]

       author="Kira Clingen"
       region="-176,0,7491,6344">

On land, the plant’s success and distribution has also led to its critical risk, as habitat destruction and over harvesting threaten its existence. *Dioscorea villosa*, as well as other *Dioscorea* species, are commonly harvested for reproductive supplements. The plant deteriorates rapidly after harvest, which privileges low-volume harvesters who supply small amounts, which increases the amount of patchy habitat destruction.[^ref36]

       region="127,2,3444,2917">

Despite the transformation of the plant from a weedy vine growing on roadsides and in deep thickets to an influential commodity, traded for the chemicals in its rhizomes, herbarium sheets following long-established botanical conventions continue to represent *Dioscorea* as a leafy specimen on herbaria sheets devoid of underground life and its broader impact. This kind of botanical representation, for a plant that has been at the center of bioprospecting campaigns for almost a century, fails to communicate the ongoing entanglement of a plant exploited for economic gain .

A new, complementary herbarium sheet is needed to express the complexity of the scientific revolution that Marker’s degradation with *Dioscorea villosa* began over half a century ago. By redrawing the plant with its attendant agents - from the mortar and pestle that indigenous women used to create medicine, to the trowels used by Marker to collect the root, to the laboratory equipment used to isolate diosgenin, and the birth control pill that resulted from Marker’s experiments with the genus, with diosgenin flowing from its roots to the global oceans – we understand the reach of the plant, from the eastern United States to the entire globe.
